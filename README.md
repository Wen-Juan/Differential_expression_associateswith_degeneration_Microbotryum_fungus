# Differential gene expression is associated with degeneration of mating-type chromosomes in the absence of sexual antagonism
In this project, we aim to investigate whether haploid selection and dosage compensation are present in Microbotryum parasitic fungi, if so, the evolutionary consequences of the two mechanisms. We combine datasets from whole genome sequencing and RNAseq of gene expression.

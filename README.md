# Haploid selection and dosage compensation in Microbotryum fungi
In this project, we aim to investigate whether haploid selection and dosage compensation are present in Microbotryum parasitic fungi, if so, the evolutionary consequences of the two mechanisms. We combine datasets from whole genome sequencing and RNAseq of gene expression.

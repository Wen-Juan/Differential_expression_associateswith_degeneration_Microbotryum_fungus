## Differential gene expression is associated with degeneration of mating-type chromosomes in the absence of sexual antagonism

### In this project, we aim to investigate the association between differential gene expression and sequence degeneration on mating-type chromosome in an anther smut fungus species Microbotryum lychnidis-dioicae. The various forms of degenerative traits we are analyzing are synonymous substitution rate (dN), transposable element insertions (TEs), premature stop codons, intron content and GC content.

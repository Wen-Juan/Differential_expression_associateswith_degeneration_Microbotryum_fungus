#### /input/Stopcodon/ 


Within this folder, there are files that show ratios of protein/coding sequence length between a1 and a2 alleles (with oriented differences between alleles based on gene expression levels). There are also files for genes with unequal protein length between given alleles, and we then quantified the indel number, premature stop codon numbers across genomic compartments.

#### /input/Intron_content/ 


Within this folder, there are files that show both oriented and nonoriented intron length differences between DE and Non-DE genes. In addition, there are also coding sequence and protein fasta files for both a1 and a2 genomes, so we could use these files to generate the comparisons of gene prediction model bias against non-recombining regions.
